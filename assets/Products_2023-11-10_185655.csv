The polarization, achieved by aligning microscopic crystals, selectively blocks horizontally polarized light, or glare, resulting in improved visual acuity. This reduces eye-fatigue, or as we say in the sunglasses business, it does the squinting for you. It also improves color sharpness and depth of vision, enhances clarity and contrast, and offers 100% protection for your eyes against harmful UV rays from the sun. They're made to resist scratches, so your lenses stay clearer longer.","","","","","","","",""

They provide true color perception and are suitable for a wide range of activities, including driving and outdoor sports. Grey lenses reduce brightness without altering the color spectrum, making them ideal for bright, sunny days. They also offer excellent protection against harmful UV rays. Grey lenses are a classic option that complements various styles and outfits. Whether for fashion or function, grey lenses are a reliable choice for eye comfort and protection.","Ray-Ban's Elliot Small boasts an acetate frame with slender temples, providing a seamless, lightweight fit for extended wear. Its uniquely square lenses with softened corners, coupled with a high bridge design, ensure a more petite fit that gracefully complements a wide range of facial structures with smaller features.","For those with a penchant for vintage charm and a face with trim features, the Elliot Small is the ideal companion. Its iconic acetate frame design, with its new geometric shape, houses crystal lenses that are both stylish and protective. The fit is delicate, but the statement loud. For a less narrow fit, check out the Elliot Medium.","Ray-Ban's Polarized Crystal Glass Lenses are like having a high-definition upgrade for your sunglasses.

It also improves color sharpness and depth of vision, enhances clarity and contrast, and offers 100% protection for your eyes against harmful UV rays from the sun.

Evolving from the Original Wayfarer, the symbol of '60s rock vibes and '80s artistic flair, this newcomer boasts a more pronounced form, ready to embrace mega trends with audacious charisma. Tailored for the youthful spirit ready for fresh horizons, its medium fit adds depth and character to everyday style. Embrace the future while honoring the past with the Mega Wayfarer Medium.","Ray-Ban's Polarized Crystal Glass Lenses are like having a high-definition upgrade for your sunglasses. The polarization, achieved by aligning microscopic crystals, selectively blocks horizontally polarized light, or glare, resulting in improved visual acuity. This reduces eye-fatigue, or as we say in the sunglasses business, it does the squinting for you. It also improves color sharpness and depth of vision, enhances clarity and contrast, and offers 100% protection for your eyes against harmful UV rays from the sun. They're made to resist scratches, so your lenses stay clearer longer.","","","","","","","",""

Designed with less tilt than its predecessor, these sunglasses deliver a fashionable and comfortable fit for those with petite face shapes. Crafted from lightweight nylon, the New Wayfarer Small sunglasses offer durability and a sleek look, while honoring the classic Wayfarer design.

","Ray-Ban's Polarized Crystal Glass Lenses are like having a high-definition upgrade for your sunglasses. The polarization, achieved by aligning microscopic crystals, selectively blocks horizontally polarized light, or glare, resulting in improved visual acuity. This reduces eye-fatigue, or as we say in the sunglasses business, it does the squinting for you. It also improves color sharpness and depth of vision, enhances clarity and contrast, and offers 100% protection for your eyes against harmful UV rays from the sun. They're made to resist scratches, so your lenses stay clearer longer.","","","","","","","",""
